int score = 80; //declaration of an int variable 

String result; // declaration of a string variable result

if (score == 80) {
 //Condition 1 that says if score equals 80 
	result = "You passed!"; // statement 1 that says result would display you passed if score = 80
} else if{ (score > 80) // Condition 2 that says or else if score is greater than 80 
	result = "You did great!"; // statement 2, then the result would display You did great based on the condition result is > than 80
} else { // Else statement if result = or > 80
	result = "You did not pass. Try again!"; // Statement 3, then result shows you did not pass
}

System.out.println(result); // This displays whatever satisfies the if statement above and shows the result


// This code is to diplay a string variable result based on the if conditions. For example if score is equal to 80 then the statement printed out would be You passed!! 
// Since we have declared a contant score to be = 80, the result would display You passed!
